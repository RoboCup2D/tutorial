- The blue circles represent the last known positions of the opponents viewed by the player number 7 (player with the ball possession).
- The green circles represent the last known positions of the teammates viewed by the player number 7 (player with the ball possession).
- The orange circle with a X on its center represents the position where the player number 7 tried to pass the ball.
- The tracing red line represents the probable ball path.
- The black line from the player number 6 to the player number 7 indicates that the player 7 received a message sent by the player 6.
- On the left top corner right below the Helios_base team name, information about players communications are written. In this example, the player 7 has three actions to be taken: move (BasicMove78), turn its neck to scan the field (NeckScan) and do not attack (AttOff).

All this information can be selected using the main menu at _Debug > Debug Message_.

To view the debug information of a match replay, you need to add the flag _--log-dir DIRECTORY_ in the start.sh script of your team and also add the flags _--debug --debug-server-connect_ (where DIRECTORY is the folder where you want to save the match logs) é o diretório onde você deseja salvar os logs). When the match is over, you only need to open the match RCG file and the log files using the File menu.
